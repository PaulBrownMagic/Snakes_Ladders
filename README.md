#Snakes and Ladders
A simple console game where players compete to make it to the
final square on the board. Rolling doubles will make you slide
back.

Written in C++.

The snakes and ladders are read in from a file as obstacles that
either move the player forward or backward a set number of tiles.
The file's format is one obstacle per line: tile number, direction,
distance

The obstacle file can be changed to any desired combination and
number of obstacles.
